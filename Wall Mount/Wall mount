## Features

- **Compact Design**: Optimized for strength and material efficiency.
- **Cable Management**: Includes a circular cutout to route cables or components.
- **Easy Mounting**: Three countersunk holes (3.40 THRU and 6.55 X 90Â°) in the vertical flange for secure wall mounting.
- **Smooth Edges**: Rounded edges (e.g., R16.00, R5.00) for safety and aesthetic appeal.
- **Symmetry**: A compact and symmetric layout for ease of manufacturing and installation.
